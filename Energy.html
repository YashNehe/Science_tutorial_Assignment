<h1>What is Energy?</h1>

The scientific definition of energy may be stated as follows:

Energy is the quantitative property that is transferred to an object and is recognizable either in the form of heat, <br>
light, sound, etc. or in the performance of work.
<p>  <b>Types of Energy
<br>
*Potential Energy:-</b>
Potential energy is often connected to the position of an object. For example, 
<br>an object on Earth has gravitational potential energy that increases as we go upwards from the surface. 
<br>Similarly, an electron in an atom has potential energy that rises as it approaches the nucleus.
<br> Another common example is the potential energy of an object that is attached to a spring.
<br>
<br>
<b>*Kinetic Energy:-</b>
Kinetic energy is associated with movement and velocity. <br>
When an object is moving with a certain velocity, it possesses energy we term kinetic energy.<br>
 The formula for kinetic energy is quite simple. It is given as 
<br>
<br>
<b>*Mechanical Energy:-</b>
Mechanical energy is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies of an object. <br>
This is not a separate form of energy. However,
<br> the forces that cause potential energy and motion are both studied under the concept of mechanics. 
<br>Hence, we have the term mechanical energy.
<br>
<br>
<b>*Thermal Energy:-</b>
The energy that is associated with heat is known as thermal energy. 
<br>It can be generated in a large number of ways. For instance, an object on fire generates enormous amounts of thermal energy.
<br> A lot of chemical reactions are exothermic and release thermal energy as well.
<br>
<br>
<b>*Sonic Energy:-</b>
Just like the heat is a form of energy, the sound is energy as well. 
<br>The energy associated with sound is known as sonic energy. 
<br>It is carried across space by sound waves, which cannot propagate in a vacuum.
